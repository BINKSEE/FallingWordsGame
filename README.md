# FallingWordsGame
Falling Words Game for Game Programming (unfinished)

This game is unfinished. I had issues creating the modifications while holding on to the integrity
of the game. 
I did make three scenes. An intro, main, and exit scene. At one point I could move between them. 
I DID finish the Brackeys main game but as previously stated, I could not implement the modifications 
without messing up the base game. :( 
I will return to finish.
